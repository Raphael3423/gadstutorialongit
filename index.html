              "Katherine Johnson contributed to various NASA projects, including calculating the trajectory of Alan
               Shepard’s flight in 1961, when he became the first American in space. According to NASA, Johnson also
               verified the calculations made by early electronic computers of John Glenn’s 1962 launch to orbit and
               the 1969 Apollo 11 trajectory to the moon."
